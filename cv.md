## About Me

I am a versatile and curious learner with a background in film sound engineering, where I developed a keen ear for detail and a strong sense of storytelling through audio. Currently, I’m diving into the world of frontend development, combining my creative instincts with technical precision. I have a basic command of Figma for UI design and prototyping, and I enjoy exploring the intersection of design, code, and user experience.
